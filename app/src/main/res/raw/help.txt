This app can track your work time easily! It lets you categorize each recorded interval by a client/task and a free text. Of course, the list of clients/tasks can be edited to suit your needs.<br>
<br>
Additionally, if you wish, your flexible time account is taken care of: you always see how much you worked. You can also keep an eye on how much work time is left for today or for the current week (by a notification which you can enable).<br>
<br>
You even may provide the geo-coordinates of your work place and the app can automatically clock you in while you are at work. This is done without using GPS, so your battery won't be emptied by this app.<br>
<br>
You also may provide a Wi-Fi network name which is visible at your work place the app can use to clock in automatically when this SSID is in range (you don't need to be connected to this network). Of course you should have Wi-Fi enabled for this to work.<br>
<br>
If you prefer to use other apps like Llama or Tasker for tracking your movements, that's fine - TWT can be triggered from these apps and just do the book-keeping of your work time. In this case, you have to create broadcast intents called org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.ClockIn or org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.ClockOut. When using ClockIn, you can also set the parameters task=... and text=... in the "extra" section of the intent so your events are more meaningful. For more details on this, see the web site.<br>
<br>
The latest version even can notify you via your Pebble smart watch on clock-in and clock-out events!
<br>
Finally, the app can generate reports for you. The raw events report is the right thing if you want to import your data somewhere else, while year/month/week reports are fine if you want to keep track of your task progress.
